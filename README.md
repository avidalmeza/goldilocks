# Goldilocks: The “Just Right” Can 
Neutrons are [a non-destructive probe to study materials on an atomic scale](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/industry/why-neutrons). [Because of their neutral charge](https://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i8/Making-Use-Neutrons.html), neutrons can penetrate deep into a sample [across a range of sample environments](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Why-and-how-to-use-neutrons-and-muons.aspx). Additionally, [due to their mass and nuclear spin](https://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i8/Making-Use-Neutrons.html), neutrons are also sensitive to the location and orientation of magnetic moments. Unlike other probes, neutrons scatter from the nuclei of atoms rather than the electron clouds, making them sensitive to light elements and allowing them to [distinguish between different isotopes](https://doi.org/10.2138/gselements.17.3.155). As a result, neutron sciences research offers invaluable insight into challenges across energy, nanotechnology, transportation, communication, and several other areas. 

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) operates 11 spectrometers and 12 diffractometers, including powder diffraction instruments at Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Powder neutron diffraction experiments can determine the magnetic and crystallographic structure of materials and [reveal how to make the materials stronger, lighter, and perform better](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/industry/why-neutrons). Sample preparation, particularly the selection of the right sample holder, is important for powder neutron diffraction. If a sample can is too small, then there is insufficient scattering and the measurement is too slow. However, if a sample can is too large, surplus scattering occurs and the measurement may be inaccurate due to multiple scattering events of the neutron.

The cross-section ($\sigma$) is the likelihood of the incident neutron interacting with a target nucleus and differs across elements and isotopes as well as sample holder geometries. *Goldilocks* calculates the total scattering cross-section and absorption cross-section for powder samples for all standard cans (flat plate, cylinder, and annular). So that external users and internal scientists at SNS and HFIR can choose the "just right" can for their experiment and sample growers may know how much sample is required early in sample preparation.
